module Cmdr
  # Device provides a DSL for describing devices of all
  # kinds. Anything that can be controlled by a computer--whether by
  # IR, serial, ethernet, or laser pulse--can be described by this
  # DSL. Furthermore, in order to be part of the Cmdr system, a
  # device _must_ be implemented as a Device. New devices are created
  # by either subclassing Device directly or by subclassing one of its
  # child classes, like RS232Device, Projector, or VideoSwitcher. If
  # there exists a class like Projector which describes the category
  # of devices that your device is pat of you should subclass it
  # instead of Device directly.  Doing so will give your projector the
  # same basic interface as every other, making it easy to exchange
  # for another. With Device, all of the details of communicating with
  # the outside world and updating the database are taken care of for
  # you, letting you focus on just implementing the device's features.
  # 
  # #Device Variables
    #
  # The basis for this DSL is the concept of state variables, defined
  # by the state_var method.  State vars are--as their name
  # suggests--variables that track the state of something about the
  # device. For example, a projector device might have have a state
  # var "power," which is true if the projector is on and false if the
  # projector is off. There are two kinds of state vars: those that
  # are immutable (e.g., the model number of the projector) and those
  # that are mutable (e.g., the aforementioned power state var).
  # Mutability is specified when the state var is created by the
  # :editable parameter, which defaults to true. Note that even an
  # immutable state var can be changed programatically by calling its
  # `device.varname=` method, but controls for it will not be created
  # in the web interface. For mutable vars you are responsible for
  # creating a method called set_varname, which takes in one argument
  # of the type specified and which should affect the device in such a
  # way as to transition it to the state described by the argument.
  # Alternatively, by passing a Proc to the :action parameter,
  # state_var will create the set method for you. State vars can be
  # created by placing a line like this in your class body:
  # 
  #   state_var power, :type => :boolean
  # 
  # The type field is mandatory, but there are various other optional
  # parameters which are described in the {Device::state_var} method
  # definition.
  # 
  # However, not every action on a device fits into the state var
  # paradigm, though you should try to use it if possible. For
  # example, a camera may have a "zoom in" and "zoom out" feature, but
  # no way to set the zoom level directly. In these cases, a command
  # can be used instead. Calling a command sends a message to the
  # device class but does not include any state information. To
  # declare a command, the syntax below should be used:
  # 
  #   command zoom_in
  # 
  # In addition, you should create a method with the same name as the
  # command (zoom_in in this case) which does the actual work of
  # sending the command to the device. Command also has many options,
  # which can be found in the {Device::command} method definition.
  # 
  # Rounding out the trio of variable types, we have
  # virtual_var. Virtual var is in some ways the opposite of command:
  # instead of providing only control, it provides only
  # information. More importantly, it is not set directly, but is
  # computed from one or more other variables. The purpose of this is
  # primarily to provide useful information for the web interface to
  # display. For example, a projector may report the number of hours a
  # lamp has been in use as well as the percentage of the lamp's life
  # that is gone. However, the more useful metric for somebody
  # evaluating when the lamp needs to be replaced is the number of
  # hours that are left before the lamp dies. We can use simple
  # algebra and a virtual var to compute this information:
  # 
  #   virtual_var :lamp_remaining, :type => :string, :depends_on => [:lamp_hours, :percent_lamp_used], :transformation => proc {
  #     "#{((lamp_hours/percent_lamp_used - lamp_hours)/(60*60.0)).round(1)} hours"
  #   }
  # 
  # Virtual vars are updated whenever the variables they depend on
  # (which can be either state vars or other virtual vars) are
  # updated.
  # 
  # #Configuration
  # Configuration is defined by a configure block, like this, from RS232Device:
  # 
  #   configure do
  #     port :type => :port
  #     baud :type => :integer, :default => 9600
  #     data_bits 8
  #     stop_bits 1
  #     parity 0
  #     message_end "\r\n"
  #   end
  # 
  # Here we can see two kind of configuration statements: system
  # defined and user defined.  The first two, port and baud, are user
  # defined, while the rest are system defined. User defined config
  # vars are intended to be set by the user in the web interface. The
  # type parameter is a hint to the web interface about what kind of
  # control to show and what kind of validation to do on the
  # input. For example, setting a type of :port will display a
  # drop-down of the serial ports defined for the system. A type of
  # :integer will display a text box whose input is restricted to
  # numbers. Other possibilities are :password, :string, :decimal,
  # :boolean and :percentage. If you supply a type that is not defined
  # in the system, a simple text box will be used. An optional
  # :default parameter can be used to set the initial value.
  # 
  # System defined config vars, on the other hand, are not modifiable
  # by the user. They are specified in the device definition (as can
  # be seen here) and cannot change. You can add whatever
  # configuration variables you need, though they should be named
  # using lowercase letters connected\_by\_underscores. Configuration
  # information is accessible through the {Device#configuration}
  # method, which returns a hash mapping between a symbol of the name
  # to the value. More information in the {Device::configure} method
  # definition.
  # 
  # #Controlling Devices
  #
  # Devices are controlled externally through the use of a message
  # queue which speaks the [AMQP](http://www.amqp.org/) protocol. At
  # the moment we use [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) as the
  # message broker, but technically everything should work with
  # another broker and RabbitMQ should not be assumed. AMQP is a very
  # complicated protocol which can support several different messaging
  # strategies. The only one used here is the simplest: direct
  # messaging, wherein there is one sender and one recipient. AMQP
  # messages travel over "queues," which are named structures that
  # carry messages in one direction. Each device has a queue, named
  # cmdr:dqueue:{name} (replace {name} with the actual name of the
  # device), which it watches for messages. Messages are JSON
  # documents with at least three pieces of information: a unique ID
  # (GUIDs are recommended to ensure uniqueness), a response queue
  # which the sender is watching, and a type. The device will carry
  # out the instructions in the message and send the response as a
  # json message to the queue specified.
  # 
  # ##Messages
  # There are three kinds of messages one can send to a device:
  # 
  # ###state_get To get information about the current state of a
  # variable, send a state_get message, which looks like the
  # following:
  # 
  #   !!!json
  #   {
  #     id: "DD2297B4-6982-4804-976A-AEA868564DF3",
  #     queue: "cmdr:http"
  #     type: "state_get",
  #     var: "input"
  #   }
  # 
  # A state_get message returns a response like the following:
  # 
  #   !!!json
  #   {
  #     id: "DD2297B4-6982-4804-976A-AEA868564DF3",
  #     result: 5 
  #   }
  # 
  # ###state_set
  # To set a state_var, send a state_set message
  # 
  #   !!!json
  #   {
  #     id: "D62F993B-E036-417C-948B-FEA389480984",
  #     queue: "cmdr:websocket"
  #     type: "state_set",
  #     var: "input",
  #     value: 4
  #   }
  # 
  # The response will look like this:
  # 
  #   !!!json
  #   {
  #     "id": "FF00F317-108C-41BD-90CB-388F4419B9A1",
  #     "result": true
  #   }
  # 
  # ###command
  # To send a command to a device, use this:
  # 
  #   !!!json
  #   {
  #     id: "FF00F317-108C-41BD-90CB-388F4419B9A1",
  #     queue: "cmdr:http"
  #     type: "command",
  #     method: "power",
  #     args: [true]
  #   }
  # 
  # Which will produce a response like:
  # 
  #   !!!json
  #   {
  #     "id": "FF00F317-108C-41BD-90CB-388F4419B9A1",
  #     "result": "power=true"
  #   }
  # 
  # Any of these calls can also produce an error. Error responses look like this:
  # 
  #   !!!json
  #   {
  #     "id": "FF00F317-108C-41BD-90CB-388F4419B9A1",
  #     "error": "Failed to turn projector on"
  #   }
  # 
  # This and the rest of the documentation here should cover
  # everything you need to know to write Device subclasses. More
  # information can also be found in the tests, which define exactly
  # what the device class must do and not do.

    # Starts a configuration block, wherein you can define config

    # defined config vars are intended to be set by the user in the
    # web interface, whereas system defined config variables are given
    # a value when created and cannot be modified by the user. This
    # should be used for defining things that are intrinsic to the
    # device, like RS232 connection parameters (i.e., data bits, stop
    # bits, parity). Defining a system defined config variable is very
    # simple: all it takes is the name and the value, on the same
    # line. A user defined config variable has two options, which are
    # given as parameters: the type and an optional default value. The
    # type parameter is a hint to the web interface about what kind of
    # control to show and what kind of validation to do on the
    # input. For example, setting a type of :port will display a
    # drop-down of the serial ports defined for the system. A type of
    # :integer will display a text box whose input is restricted to
    # numbers. Other possibilities are :password, :string, :decimal,

    # This method, when called in a class definition, defines a new

    # the device. For example, a projector device might have have a
    # state var "power," which is true if the projector is on and
    # false if the projector is off. There are two kinds of state
    # vars: those that are immutable (e.g., the model number of the
    # projector) and those that are mutable (e.g., the aforementioned
    # power state var).  Mutability is specified when the state var is
    # created by the :editable parameter, which defaults to true. Note
    # that even an immutable state var can be changed programatically
    # by calling its device.state_var= method, but controls for it
    # will not be created in the web interface.
    # 
    # Calling state_var can do a number of things. In every case, it
    # will create a getter method for the variable with the name
    # passed in, so that instances of your class will respond to
    # #var_name. It will also create a setter method `#varname=` which
    # should be used to update the state. You should always use the
    # setter to change state rather than access the instance variable
    # directly because the setter will report changes to the database,
    # which is neccessary for any user interface to update. It also
    # forces recalculation on any virtual variables that are defined
    # in terms of a particular state var. In addition to creating
    # accessor methods, if supplied an :action parameter state_var
    # will create a set_varname method using the proc supplied.
    #
    # @param [Symbol] name The name for the state var. Should follow
    #   the general naming conventions: all lowercase, with multiple
    #   words connected\_by\_underscores.
    # @param [Hash] options Options for configuring the state_var
    # @option options [Symbol] :type [mandatory] the type of the
    #   variable; this is used by the web interface to decide what
    #   kind of interface to show. Possible values are :boolean,
    #   :string, :percentage, :number, :decimal, :option, and :array.
    # @option options [Boolean] :editable (true) whether or not this
    #   variable can be set by the user.
    # @option options [Integer] :display_order Used by the web
    #   interface to decide which variables are visible and in which
    #   order they are displayed. For a particular device, the var
    #   with the lowest :display_order is ranked highest, followed by
    #   the next lowest up to 6. Leave out if the variable should not
    #   be shown.
    # @option options [Array<#to_json>] :options If :option is
    #   selected for type, the elements in this array serve as the
    #   allowable options.
    # @option options [Proc] :action If a proc is supplied to :action,
    #   then state_var will automatically create a set_varname method
    #   (where varname is the name of the state variable) which
    #   executes the code provided. The difference between the
    #   set_varname method and `#varname=` method is this: the former
    #   is used to actually change the state of the device (i.e., it
    #   sends a command to the device that ideally results in it
    #   entering the desired state) whereas the latter informs
    #   cmdr the actual state of the device.
    # @example
    #   state_var :input, 
    #     :type => :option, 
    #     :display_order => 1,

    # This method, when called in a class definition, creates a new
    # virtual variable. A virtual variable is one that cannot be set
    # directly, but which is composed automatically from one or more
    # other variables (either virtual or not). The purpose of this is
    # primarily to provide useful information for the web interface to
    # display. For example, a projector may report the number of hours
    # a lamp has been in use as well as the percentage of the lamp's
    # life that is gone. However, the more useful metric for somebody
    # evaluating when the lamp needs to be replaced is the number of
    # hours that are left before the lamp dies. We can use simple
    # algebra and a virtual var to compute this information, as seen
    # in the example. Virtual vars are updated whenever the variables
    # they depend on either state vars or other virtual vars) are
    # updated.
        # @param [Symbol] name The name for the virtual var. Should follow
    #   the general naming convention: all lowercase, with multiple
    #   words connected\_by\_underscores.
    # @param [Hash] options Options for configuring the virtual var
    # @option options [Array<Symbol>] :depends_on [mandatory] An array
    #   of the variables' names that this one depends on. Note that
    #   these must have been defined already.
    # @option options [Proc] :transformation [mandatory] A proc with
    #   arity 0 which is run in the context of the device instance
    #   (which means you have access to instance variables and
    #   methods). This proc will be called whenever one of the
    #   constituent variables changes, and should return the new value
    #   of the virtual variable.
    # @option options [Integer] :display_order Used by the web
    #   interface to decide which variables are visible and in which
    #   order they are displayed. For a particular device, the var
    #   with the lowest :display_order is ranked highest, followed by
    #   the next lowest up to 6. Leave out if the variable should not
    #   be shown.
    # @example
    #   virtual_var :lamp_remaining, :type => :string, :depends_on => [:lamp_hours, :percent_lamp_used], :transformation => proc {
    #     "#{((lamp_hours/percent_lamp_used - lamp_hours)/(60*60.0)).round(1)} hours"

    # feature but no command for setting the zoom level
    # directly. However, for situation where the command is changing
    # an obverable state, like with on/off, a state var should be used
    # instead. In addition to calling `command`, you should create a
    # method with the same name as the command--this will be called
    # when the command is activated by the user.  Alternatively, you
    # can pass in a proc to :action which will create this method

    # @option options [Symbol, Array<Symbol>] type The type of the

    #   multiple, supply an array of types. These types are used by
    #   the web interface to determine what kind of interface to

    # @option options [Array<#to_json>] options If :option is selected
    #   for type, the elements in this array serve as the allowable

    #   then `command` will automatically create a method with the

    #   user triggers the command, so it should communicate with the
    #   device and take the desired action.

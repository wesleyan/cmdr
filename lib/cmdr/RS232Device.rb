module Cmdr
  # RS232Device is a subclass of {Cmdr::Device} that makes the
  # job of controlling devices that communicate over RS232 serial
  # ports easier. At its most basic level, it will handle
  # communication through a serial port (using the
  # [ruby-serialport](http://ruby-serialport.rubyforge.org/) library)
  # for you, providing {#send_string} and {#read}, which respectively
  # send and receive strings to and from the device. However, most
  # devices should be able to take advantage of the various "managed"
  # features, which can greatly simplify the task of writing drivers
  # for RS232 devices. In fact, using this class it is possible to
  # write drivers without any real code at all (besides some string
  # handling).
  # 
  # There are several abstractions provided which can take over a part
  # of device handling.  Perhaps the most widely applicable is the
  # {RS232Device::requests requests} abstraction.  Many devices will
  # not send messages to notify a state change and must be constantly
  # polled to maintain correct state in the Cmdr system (i.e., if
  # a projector is turned off manually, you must request its power
  # state in order to display that fact on the touchscreen). You can
  # use `request` to do such polling automatically. You can provide as
  # many requests as you'd like, and each can have an associated
  # priority which informs how often is should be sent. Look at the
  # {RS232Device::requests} documentation for more information.
  # 
  # The next abstraction is {RS232Device::responses
  # responses}. Responses provide automatic handling of incoming data
  # from the device. Each response has a "matcher," which can be a
  # string, regular expression or a function. When a message comes
  # over the wire from the device, it is matched against all of the
  # responses. If one matches, the message is passed to the handler
  # function provided, which will generally update one or more
  # state_vars based on the information provided.
  # 
  # The final abstraction is {RS232Device::managed_state_var}. A
  # managed state var is like a normal {Device::state_var} except that
  # the set_ method is created automatically based on a string
  # function provided to :action.
  # 
  # Using these three abstractions, you can write device drivers using
  # very little code. For example, here's a subset of the
  # ExtronVideoSwitcher driver (the full source can be found
  # [here](https://github.com/mwylde/cmdr-devices/blob/master/ExtronVideoSwitcher.rb)).
  # 
  #   configure do
  #     baud        9600
  #     message_end "\r\n"
  #   end
  # 
  #   managed_state_var :input, 
  #     :type => :option, 
  #     :display_order => 1, 
  #     :options => ("1".."6").to_a,
  #     :action => proc{|input|
  #       "#{input}!\r\n"
  #     }
  # 
  #   responses do
  #     match :channel,  /Chn(\d)/, proc{|m| self.input = m[1].to_i.to_s}
  #     match :volume,   /Vol(\d+)/, proc{|m| self.volume = m[1].to_i/100.0}
  #     match :mute,     /Amt(\d+)/, proc{|m| self.mute = m[1] == "1"}
  #     match :status,   /Vid(\d+) Aud(\d+) Clp(\d)/, proc{|m|
  #       self.input = m[1].to_i if m[1].to_i > 0
  #       self.clipping = (m[2] == "1")
  #     }
  #   end
  # 
  #   requests do
  #     send :input, "I\r\n", 0.5
  #     send :volume, "V\r\n", 0.5
  #     send :mute, "Z\r\n", 0.5
  #   end
  # 
  # These abstractions are designed around devices that have the following message lifecycle:
  # 
  # 1. A message is sent from the controller to the device
  # 2. The device processes the event and sends back a response,
  #    either an acknowledge or a full response.
  # 3. The device is now ready for a new message, starting the cycle over.
  # 
  # In particular, since many devices can only handle one message at a
  # time, RS232Device waits until a response is received or
  # message_timeout seconds have passed before sending the next
  # message in the queue. Devices with more complex message handling
  # (for example, those with multiple message queues) may not work
  # optimally with this strategy. In those cases, writing the message
  # handling system yourself may be preferable. It is also very
  # important that devices are synchronous; i.e., they always send
  # responses in the order that requests or commands are received. If
  # this assumption does not hold, users may get incorrect responses.
  # 
  # ##Configuration
  # RS232Devices have addition configuration parameters, which can be
  # placed in the normal {Device::configure} block.
  # 
  # + *port*: the serial port the device is connected to. You
  #   shouldn't set this directly, because it should be modifiable by
  #   the user
  # + *baud*: the baud rate at which communication occurs. You can
  #   either set this, if the device uses a fixed baud rate, or let
  #   the user set it if the device supports variable baud rates 
  # + *data_bits*: the number of data bits used by the device (usually 7 or 8)
  # + *stop_bits*: the number of stop bits used by the device (either 1 or 2)
  # + *parity*: the kind of parity checking used; can be 0, 1 or 2
  #    which are NONE, EVEN and ODD respectively
  # + *message_end*: the character(s) which demarcate the end of a
  #   message; for ASCII-based protocols usually a newline ("\n") or a
  #   carriage return and newline ("\r\n"). You must set this if you
  #   want message interpretation to work correctly. Alternatively,
  #   you can supply a proc which takes one argument (a string) and
  #   which returns true if the string represents a valid message or
  #   false otherwise. This is useful for binary protocols where a
  #   message is demarcated by a valid checksum rather than a specific
  #   symbol.
  # + *message_timeout*: the number of seconds to wait before sending
  #   the next message after a message fails to elicit a response
  # + *message_delay*: The number of seconds to wait before sending
  #   the next message after a message has successfully gotten a
  #   response. Some devices can't take a constant barrage of message,
  #   so a delay is necessary
  # + *wait_until_ack*: if true, specifies that no messages should be
  #   sent until an ack has been received, rather than the default
  #   behavior which is to send the next when any message has been
  #   received. However, if message_timeout seconds have passed since
  #   the last response the next message will be sent regardless.

    # Starts a responses block, wherein statements which describe the
    # various kinds of responses the device can send are placed. There
    # are four kinds of responses:
    # 
    # + *match*, which is used for general responses
    # + *ack*, which is used for acknowledge responses, sent by
    #   devices to announce that the message has been received and the
    #   next can be sent
    # + *nack*, not acknowledged, meaning that the message was
    #   received but could not be interpretted or executed
    # + *error*, meaning that there was some error running the
    #    previous message
    # 
    # Match is used most frequently, whereas the others are applicable
    # only to some devices which have those features. Each response
    # takes a matcher, which can either be a string, regular
    # expression or a proc. Whenever a message is received, it is
    # compared to each of the matchers that have been defined in
    # order, and the first matcher to match (defined as being equal
    # for strings, returning a non-nil value from `String#match` for
    # regular expression, or returning a true value when supplied the
    # message for procs) is used.  When a response created with
    # `match` is selected, the supplied "interpreter" proc is called,
    # which will generally update state vars. The argument to the
    # interpreter depends on the matcher type. For strings, no
    # argument is supplied; for regular expressions, the matcher
    # object is supplied; for procs, the original message is
    # supplied. When an `error` response is matched, the supplied
    # message is returned to the user. When either an `ack` or `nack`
    # response is matched, the next message is sent and no futher
    # action taken.
    # 
    # `match` takes three arguments: a name, a matcher and an
    # interpreter. `nack` and `ack` each take only a matcher. `error`
    # takes a name, a matcher and a string message.
    #
    # Note that response can be used in two ways: a in the first
    # example, in which case the provided block is evaluated in the
    # context of a special class (which means code inside of the block
    # has no access to local variables or methods), or by providing a
    # parameter into the block, in which case the block is evaluated
    # in the context of the class (*not the instance*), but response
    # methods (like `match`) must be called on that argument (see the
    # second example).
    # @example
    #   responses do
    #     #regular expression matcher
    #     match :volume, /Vol(\d+)/, proc{|m| self.volume = m[1].to_i/100.0}
    #     #string matcher
    #     match :powered_on, "power=on", proc{ self.power = true}
    #     #proc matcher
    #     match :input, proc{|m| m[0] == 2 && m[1] == 0x15}, proc{|m| self.input = m[4].to_i * 2**8 + m[5].to_i}
    #     ack "ack"
    #     nack "nack"
    #     error :power_error, "power_error", "Projector failed to turn on"
    #   end

    # Starts a requests block, wherein statements describing the
    # various requests that should be made of the device are
    # placed. Many devices do not proactively report state changes to
    # their controller and need to be constantly polled to determine
    # whether anything has changed. In order to provide the user a
    # feeling of control, it is important that the current system
    # state always reflect the device's real state as closely as
    # possible.  For example, the default touchscreen interface does
    # not allow you to turn on a projector that is already
    # on. However, if the controller does not poll for the power
    # state, the projector could be manually turned off and the
    # controller would be unaware. Now, the projector is off but the
    # system still thinks it's on, and the user is unable to turn it
    # back on using the touchscreen.
    # 
    # Creating requests is very simple. Each request needs three
    # things: a name, the string to send, and its priority compared to
    # other requests. The priority is a floating point number which
    # determines how often the request is sent. If we have two
    # requests, A with priority 1.0 and B with priority 0.5, request A
    # will be sent roughly twice as often as request B. The numbers
    # are entirely relative, so you can use whatever scale you
    # like. The system will send a request whenever the channel is
    # clear (we are not waiting for a response) and there are no
    # commands waiting to be sent, so user commands are still
    # prioritized but states are kept as up to date as possible. When
    # requests are defined a vector is created with the sequence of
    # requests to send. Every time a request can be sent, the next
    # request is taken from this vector. The number of copies of each
    # request in this vector is determined by the priorities.  In
    # essence, we scale all of the priorities such that the smallest
    # is one; these scaled priorities are then the number of
    # copies. We then interleave them as much as possible so that
    # there is a regular spacing between requests.
    #
    # Note that requests can be used in two ways: a in the first
    # example, in which case the provided block is evaluated in the
    # context of a special class (which means code inside of the block
    # has no access to local variables or methods), or by providing a
    # parameter into the block, in which case the block is evaluated
    # in the context of the class (*not the instance*), but request
    # methods (specifically `send`) must be called on that argument
    # (see the second example).
    # @example
    #   requests do
